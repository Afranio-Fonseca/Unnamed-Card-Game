# Effect types
Units and lands may have trigger effects and continuous effects, tech cards have a effect that goes off once when they are played before they get sent to the trash and is resolved like a trigger effect.

## Trigger effects
These effects have a trigger timing in which they are triggered.

#### Zones a trigger effect occurs
Cards with triggers that may happen outside of the unit or land zones will indicate all the zones they may trigger before the trigger description.

#### Mandatory and optional triggers
If after the trigger description there is a '?' it means the player can refuse to activate it when the trigger occurs, the activation is mandatory otherwise.

#### Trigger conditions
Some triggers may have conditions on top of the actual trigger, these may reffer to a specific zone it has to happen or a tribe the card must belong, reffer to the [documentation on triggers](Trigger-list.md).

#### Effect conditions
Each effect may contain a condition for it to happen, if the condition isn't met the effect doesn't happen.

Some effect conditions allow the player to choose how to fulfill it and when doing so may alter how the effect is resolved, the text "choose up to X cards" is displayed before the condition allowing for the player to choose X amount of cards or less to take part in fulfilling the effect condition,

The effect may refer to X amount in order to determine how it is supposed to be resolved.

#### Resolving trigger effects

The activated effects occur in order as they are on the card's description, it doesn't matter if an effect can't change the current game state the effects continues to resolve.

## Continuous effects
These effects will continue to happen as long as their source remains in a zone where it occurs.

#### Zones a continuous effect is enabled
Cards with continuous effects that are enabled outside the unit or land zones will indicate all the zones they remain enabled before their reach & conditions or description.

#### Continuous effect reach & conditions
Continuous effects may only reach cards at a certain zone and/or of a specific tribe, their reach & conditions are described before the effect and that effect only applies to cards within the effect's reach and that meet its conditions.
